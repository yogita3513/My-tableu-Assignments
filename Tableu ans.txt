Replace references is a feature in Tableau that 
allows you to swap one fieldfor another in our workbook. 
It can be useful when your data source changes or when 
you want to change the field used in your analysis. 
To use it, right-click on the field you want to replace and 
select Replace References. This will update all the references to the old field in our workboo.
EXample : If we used customer number and sales in analysis 
 and now if we want to analysis with customer name we can use replce reference and we can change customernumer to customername 
and correspondinhg  view also get changed.

There are different ways to handle null values for measures in Tableau, such as:

1.Formatting the nulls to hide them or show them as a different value.

2.Filtering out the null values from the view or the data source.
3.Using a calculated field to replace the null values with a default value or an aggregation.
We can use ZN formula  it will return 0 for Null values..
